            <p>
                What's up guys! My name is Vernell (or you can just call me Vee) and I am a graduate from The University of New Orleans with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
                I've had a passion for computers in general since I was a kid but ever since I took my first (and very intoductory) class on web development in HS, I've been in love
                with coding and web development ever since!    
            </p>
    
            <p>
                My main passion revolves around art and creativity. I have always loved trying to be unique with everything I do in my life. Whether it's the fashion choices I make,
                the lingo that I use on a daily basis, or the way I think and carry myself; I like to standout from the crowd and show people a little about myself through my creativity.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Outide of computers and coding, I love to be outdoors and I love to remain active. Some of my hobbies includes relaxing activites such as relaxing walks on nature trails 
                and setting up shop by the lake and become memerized by the oddly satisfying motion of the waves hitting the shore. I also love competition as well and I am an avid gym enthusiast so more often than not 
                you can find me at a local gym or basketball court trying to get some cardio in! A few hobbies that I'm starting to pickup are: singing/songwriting, blogging, fashion designing.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                My dream is to become a creative director so that I can help individuals and small businesses have more of an online
                presence. In this age of social media, it's crucial to have some sort of online presence which can help with marketing, online sales, and even boost self confidence.
                In my case, I just want to show the world that I can build creative and unique things using computers. The text editor is my canvas to create my world and share it with the world.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                My goal is simple. I just want to show the world a different perspective of life, from a very$ubtle point of view...
